# Tell GitHub to treat template files as a specific language or exclude them
# This will help show Python and JavaScript more prominently

# Mark HTML templates with embedded code as a different language
templates/* linguist-vendored

# Or alternatively, mark them as documentation
# templates/* linguist-documentation

# Ensure Python files are detected
*.py linguist-detectable=true

# Ensure JavaScript files are detected
*.js linguist-detectable=true

# Ensure CSS is included
*.css linguist-detectable=true
